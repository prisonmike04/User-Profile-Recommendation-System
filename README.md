# User-Profile-Recommendation-System
This project is a recommendation model designed to offer personalized suggestions to users, similar to Netflix’s recommendation system. It leverages both Scala Spark and PySpark to process and analyze large datasets efficiently.

# Overview
The User Recommendation Model is designed to provide personalized recommendations for users based on their interaction data, similar to the recommendation systems used by platforms like Netflix. This project leverages PySpark to process and analyze large datasets to generate insightful recommendations.

# Project Structure
Data Preparation:

The dataset includes various features related to user interactions, such as watch time, channel information, and user IDs.
Columns in the dataset include channel_id, cellid, program_date, program_hour, and watch_time_portrait.

Data Transformation:
The project includes steps to clean and preprocess the data.
Transformation involves selecting relevant columns, handling missing values, and creating new features if necessary.

Recommendation Model:
The core of the project is the recommendation algorithm, which uses user interaction data to predict and suggest relevant content.
This model is similar to Netflix's recommendation system, utilizing collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, or hybrid methods depending on the approach taken.

# Features
Personalized Recommendations: Offers content recommendations tailored to individual user preferences and behaviors.
Scalability: Designed to handle large volumes of data efficiently using PySpark.
Flexibility: Supports various recommendation strategies, including collaborative filtering and content-based methods.
Real-Time Integration: Capable of being integrated into a real-time system for dynamic user interaction.

# Key Components:
Data Processing: The project utilizes Spark's robust data processing capabilities to handle large-scale datasets. The data is ingested, cleaned, and prepared using Scala Spark for performance optimization.

Feature Extraction: Features relevant to user preferences and interactions are extracted and transformed. This process includes handling nested data structures and creating features necessary for the recommendation algorithms.

Model Building: PySpark is employed to build and train recommendation models. It uses collaborative filtering and other machine learning techniques to predict user preferences and generate recommendations.

Evaluation and Testing: The model’s performance is evaluated using various metrics to ensure the recommendations are accurate and relevant to users.

Integration: The system is designed to be easily integrated into existing platforms, providing real-time recommendations based on user activity and preferences.
